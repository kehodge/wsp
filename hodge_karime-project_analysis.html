       <h2>Site Intent</h2>
       
         <p>The redesign objective of Get Gaming Orlando is to make their website pages 
            more visually appealing to captivate users and increase traffic to website. 
            Also the number of pages contain in the site need to be reduce simple
            because the user wants a site that they can navigate clearly and understand
            and not get confused and frustrated by unnecessary pages. Condense pages from 7
            to 4 by eliminating hello friend, coupons, and FAQ's pages and consolidate them
            into the remaining 4 pages.</p>
            
         <p>By restructuring their website structure and pages it will make it more visually ecstatic
            and will attract more visitors and potentially more customers the to website.</p>
            
       <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
       
         <p>Because of the the competition in Orlando from many large and small companies 
            in the video game consoles and computer repair market, focusing on your up to 
            date servicing repair, your low and affordable prices and standing out above
            the rest will help to bring in more potential customers for their electronics needs.</p>
            
       <h2>Targeted Audience</h2>       
              
         <p>Our targeted audience are male teenagers to young adults (13 to 24) and small
            business owners. Our Male audience we are targeting makes between $0 and $35,000 
            are living with their parents, attending school and working part-time. Because
            money will not be abundant to purchase a new video game console or computer 
            between these ages you have a better chance having this audience come in for 
            repairs. Small business owners who are start ups or are save money, this group
            will be the second targeted audience.</p>
